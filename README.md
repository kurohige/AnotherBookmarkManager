### This project is a C#/.NET core assignment for Integrify, the purpose of this one is to evaluate my knowledge and experience working with C#. 
### To be frank it has been my first project working with C# and API's, the project is currently not completed in its entirity but the core requirements have been tested and are currently working. 
**Language**: * *C#* *
**Framework**: *ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework*

### Adding to these technologies is worth mentioning the usage of a *docker compose* htat stores the database and runs locally on my machine.
